        Let's start with the first rest on the singing voice.
        According to the <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/rest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">MEI Specification</a>,
        a rest is "a non-sounding event found in the source being transcribed". Encoding that is simple:
        Just use a <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> element, with a <code>@dur</code> attribute.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to increase your training with rests, please see the tutorial on the right hand side.</p>
